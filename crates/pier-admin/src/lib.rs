//! # admin
//!
//! The operator admin API for a Pier coordinator (BUILD-PLAN.md W7) — a kind-agnostic HTTP
//! control plane an operator runs alongside any `crates/*` coordinator-kind crate (gateway,
//! relay, reachability-adapter, ...). It composes, and never reimplements:
//!
//! - **`pier-economics`** — the signed [`pier_economics::Descriptor`]/[`pier_economics::Tariff`]
//!   types and the real `kotva-core` Ed25519 signing (CONTRACT §2.1, §6).
//! - **`pier-billing`** — [`pier_billing::Meter`]/[`pier_billing::TariffSchedule`]/
//!   [`pier_billing::ReceiptLog`] (CONTRACT §6, made concrete).
//! - **`pier-conformance`** — the COORD-1..8 checklist (CONTRACT §7).
//!
//! ## What an operator can do here
//! 1. **Descriptor** (`descriptor.rs`) — GET the current signed descriptor; PUT the policy +
//!    declared content-visibility + kind, sign it, serve it. A visibility change that weakens
//!    the declared class/level is rejected unless explicitly disclosed (`confirm_downgrade`,
//!    CONTRACT §3.2), and every PUT response carries the COORD-1..8 findings for what was just
//!    published.
//! 2. **Tariff** (`tariff.rs`) — GET/PUT the price schedule, signed into the descriptor's tariff.
//!    No token, ever (DIRECTION §5) — an attempt to configure one is rejected.
//! 3. **Metering + receipts** (`billing.rs`) — GET usage per payer and issued receipts, with the
//!    one-directional-audit caveat (CONTRACT §6, R-6) surfaced in every response.
//! 4. **Quota / rate policy** (`quota.rs`) — GET/PUT operator numbers, in-memory.
//! 5. **Keys** (`keys.rs`) — inspect the operator's public key; rotate it (re-signs the
//!    descriptor; the old public key is kept, never dropped — CONTRACT §2.1).
//! 6. **Conformance self-check** (`conformance.rs`) — GET the COORD-1..8 report for the current
//!    posture.
//!
//! ## Admin auth (SEC-1 fail-closed)
//! Every route in [`router`] requires a bearer token ([`auth::AdminAuth`]), compared in constant
//! time. **No token configured → every request is `401`** — this API manages the operator's
//! signing key, so it must default to inert, not merely undocumented. See `auth.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deployment posture — operator-local, not a delivery-path surface
//! This is the operator's own control plane, analogous to a database admin console: it is meant
//! to be reachable only by the operator (the reference binary, `bin/pier-admin`, binds loopback
//! by default — `config.rs`), and the bearer token is operator config, not a credential any end
//! user ever holds or needs. It sits on **no** user delivery/authoritative path — the descriptor,
//! tariff, and receipts it produces are exactly the discovery-only, self-asserted artifacts
//! CONTRACT §2.1/§6 already make public by design; this crate only adds the operator-side surface
//! that produces/signs them, plus quota/key management that was never content-visible to begin
//! with.
//!
//! ## Deliberate seams (left for a real deployment to fill in)
//! - **In-memory stores.** [`pier_billing::InMemoryMeter`]/[`pier_billing::ReceiptLog`] and
//!   this crate's [`descriptor::DescriptorStore`]/quota lock are process-memory only — a restart
//!   loses unbilled usage and any in-flight (unpersisted) config change. [`pier_billing::Meter`]
//!   is already a trait for exactly this reason; a real deployment backs it (and the descriptor/
//!   quota state, which this crate does not abstract behind a trait) with a durable store.
//! - **Ephemeral key by default.** With no seed configured, `main.rs` generates a fresh key at
//!   startup (loudly, to the log) rather than refusing to start — convenient for a first run, but
//!   an operator MUST configure `PIER_ADMIN_KEY_SEED_HEX`/`PIER_ADMIN_KEY_FILE` for anything
//!   that needs to keep the same accountable identity across restarts.
//! - **Rotate re-signs the descriptor only**, per the wave's own scope — a tariff already
//!   attached to the descriptor keeps its *own* (still self-certifying, still valid) signature
//!   under the *previous* key; re-signing it too under the new key on rotation is not done here.
//! - **Quota/rate numbers are declared, not enforced.** This crate stores the operator's numbers;
//!   wiring them into an actual rate limiter is the coordinator-kind data plane's job.
